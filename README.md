## Welcome to my profile!

I have been working with data since 2020. While I have completed some data science projects, I am currently specializing in data engineering.
<br>

ChatGPT once told me that I’m passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights, optimizing data workflows, and that I love collaborating with business colleagues.
